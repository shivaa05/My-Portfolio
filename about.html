                    Hi! I‚Äôm Shiva Verma, a passionate and curious Computer Science Engineering student at CGC Jhanjeri, currently in my 4th semester. I believe technology isn‚Äôt just about writing code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about solving problems, building experiences, and making life a little better, one line of code at a time.

                    My Journey So Far
                </span>
                <div class="text">
                    <br>My love for technology started when I was introduced to C and C++ in my early semesters. There was something fascinating about how logical thinking and structured code could make computers do incredible things. That logical side of programming pulled me in ‚Äî and I've never looked back.
                    <br>
                    As I explored deeper, I found a new love in web development ‚Äî where design meets logic. I started working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later adopted Tailwind CSS to streamline my frontend development. My interest lies in building clean, responsive, and intuitive interfaces that are not only user-friendly but also fun to create.
                    <br>
                    In parallel, I‚Äôve also dipped my toes into Python and Java, giving me a broader perspective on different programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches.

                <div class="text">
                    <br>I‚Äôm deeply into competitive programming and DSA. With 400+ problems solved on LeetCode, especially focused on linear data structures, I‚Äôve built a solid foundation in algorithms, logic building, and coding efficiency.
                    <br>
                    Solving problems is like a workout for my brain. It teaches me patience, resilience, and creative thinking ‚Äî skills that are crucial for any software developer.

                <div class="text">
                    <br>Nothing beats hands-on experience. I love taking concepts and turning them into real, working apps. Some of the projects I‚Äôve built so far include:
                    <br>
                    <b>Calculator App:</b> Built from scratch using HTML, CSS & JS. A clean, simple design with real-time calculations. <br>
                    <b>Chatbot:</b> A basic rule-based chatbot that helped me understand user interaction flow.
                    <br>
                    <b>Temperature Converter:</b> A fun project that reinforced DOM manipulation and logic building
                    <br>
                    <b>Weather Forecast App:</b> My intro to using external APIs, handling asynchronous code, and creating dynamic interfaces.
